          "Freemasonry spread in the 'new world' as the British Army established colonial rule. The officers were often Freemasons and they, through their association with civilian leaders in the community, established lodges. Such was the case in Amherstburg, a town on the Detroit River created in 1796 following the establishment of Fort Malden and the King's Navy Yard. The articles presented here illustrate the raising of Adoniram Lodge in the late 1790s until it's abrupt closure at the outbreak of war in 1812. A Freemasons lodge would not reappear in Amherstburg until the formation of Thistle Lodge in 1849.",

The brethren of these lodges, recognizing the challenges of economic upheaval, declining membership and changing social structures, sought to pool their resources to form one new lodge whose influence would exceed that of its three predecessors.',
        historyParagraph2:
          'They chose the name “Trinity” and the lodge symbol – the triquetra, or three-cornered Celtic knot,nested within an intertwined triangle and circle – to reflect the union of three equal, yet distinct, traditions, under the headship of the Divine Creator, and dedicated to the eternal Masonic principles of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. Since the lodges were amalgamating under the charter of the oldest of the three (Ontario Lodge), that lodge’s number was the one that would henceforth designate Trinity Lodge on the Register of Grand Lodge.',
        historyParagraph3:
          'Under the guidance of R.W. Bro. Leslie F. Armstrong, the lodges agreed to the terms of the amalgamation, which subsequently received the approval of Grand Lodge. On Monday, November 2, 2009, the Ceremony of Amalgamation took place in the Blue Room of the Windsor Masonic Temple, presided over by M.W. Bro. Raymond S.J. Daniels, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M. of Canada in the Province of Ontario, followed by the Ceremony of Installation and Investiture of Officers of the newly-formed lodge.',
        historyParagraph4:
          'Today Trinity Lodge No. 521 is a large lodge within the Essex County District. As a separate entity, it is still in its infancy. The process of merging traditions, while at the same time carving out a distinctly new identity, is an ongoing one, but the brethren remain undiminished in their fervor and look forward to many years to come.',
